I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in biomedical imaging at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), based at the [European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF)](https://www.esrf.fr/). I work with **HiP-CT**, a novel X-ray tomography technique for multi-resolution imaging of intact human organs.
