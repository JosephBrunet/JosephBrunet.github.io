Hi, Iâ€™m **Dr. Joseph Brunet**, a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk" class="text-link">University College London</a>, based at the <a href="https://www.esrf.fr" class="text-link">European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF)</a> in Grenoble.

I completed my PhD in Biomechanics at <a href="https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/" class="text-link">Ã‰cole des Mines de Saint-Ã‰tienne</a>, where I investigated the mechanisms of aortic dissection using in situ mechanical testing and X-ray tomography.

My current research focuses on biomedical imaging, leading the development and application of **Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Computed Tomography (HiP-CT)** â€” a groundbreaking technique for imaging whole human organs down to cellular resolution.

With a strong personal interest in **cardiovascular biology**, my work bridges **biomechanics**, **imaging**, and **computational analysis** to advance our understanding of human organ structure and disease.

*I'm a curious mind, always looking for new experiences and problems to solve. This has led me to explore different fields like mechanics, biology or imaging, and combined them to open perspectives on the development of personalised diagnostic tools for patients.*
