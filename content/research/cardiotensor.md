( [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/JosephBrunet/cardiotensor)](https://github.com/JosephBrunet/cardiotensor/releases) )
is an open-source Python package developed to quantify **3D cardiomyocyte orientation** and reconstruct continuous **tractography** of myoaggregates in volumetric cardiac imaging datasets.  


The library is designed for modern **high-resolution modalities** such as **synchrotron tomography (HiP-CT)**, micro-CT, and 3D optical imaging. It supports datasets up to **teravoxel scale** through chunk-based and parallelized processing pipelines.

### Key Features
- **3D Structure Tensor Analysis**: Computes voxel-wise cardiomyocyte orientation from image intensity gradients.  
- **Cardiac Microstructure Metrics**: Extracts helical angle (HA), intrusion angle (IA), and fractional anisotropy (FA).  
- **Tractography**: Reconstructs cardiomyocyte trajectories for continuous myoaggregate mapping.  
- **Scalable Processing**: Optimized for HPC clusters and terabyte-sized volumes using chunked parallelization.  
- **Visualization**: Interactive 3D rendering of vector fields and streamlines, plus VTK export for ParaView.  
- **Tissue-Agnostic**: Applicable beyond the heart to other fibrous tissues such as brain white matter, skeletal muscle, and tendon.

### Why Cardiotensor?
Most established orientation-analysis tools (e.g., MRtrix3, DIPY, DSI Studio) were developed for diffusion MRI. **Cardiotensor** instead derives orientation directly from imaging intensity gradients, enabling analysis across modalities such as synchrotron tomography, micro-CT, and optical microscopy. Unlike small-scale in-house codes, it is designed to be **scalable, reproducible, and openly accessible**.
