During my postdoc at the <a href="https://www.esrf.eu/" target="_blank" class="text-link">European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF)</a>, I used **Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT)** to depict the macro- to microanatomy of structurally normal and abnormal adult human hearts ex vivo.

HiP-CT allows for high-spatial-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of the heart, revealing histologic-level detail without the need for invasive sectioning or exogenous contrast agents. The study involved imaging two hearts: one from a healthy 63-year-old male and another from an 87-year-old female with a history of cardiovascular diseases.

The imaging revealed intricate details of the myocardium, valves, coronary arteries, and conduction system, with resolutions from **20 Âµm/voxel** down to **2 Âµm/voxel**, allowing to observe some cells such as myocytes.

HiP-CT also enabled the visualization of pathologic features such as **fatty infiltration**, **vascular supply disruptions**, and **structural changes** due to diseases like myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation.

This study demonstrates the potential of HiP-CT for detailed, non-destructive imaging of the heart, which can greatly enhance our understanding of cardiac anatomy and disease, paving the way for better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
