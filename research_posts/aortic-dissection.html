      I did this work during my PhD at <a href="https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/" target="\_blank">École des Mines de Saint-Étienne</a> as part of the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/638804" target="\_blank">AArteMIS project</a>. My research was focused on vascular biomechanics. I worked at identifying and quantifying the mechanisms behind vascular failure and especially aortic dissection in order to develop new diagnostic tools and treatments for clinics.

      To this end, I performed <em>in situ</em> experiments combining mechanical testing and imaging techniques. I created <em>in vitro</em> aortic dissections in porcine and rabbit aortas, and I observed them with X-ray micro-tomography, using either conventional or synchrotron X-ray sources.

      This approach made it possible to observe the 3D evolution of the delamination profile during the propagation of a dissection in the aortic wall.

      Using tension test combined with inverse methods, I was able to quantify the elastic and failure properties of the aortas.

      Finally, I used finite element models to model the rupture and investigate the fracture modes of the tissue.
