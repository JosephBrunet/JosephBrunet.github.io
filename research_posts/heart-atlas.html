      During my postdoc at the <a href="https://www.esrf.eu/" target="_blank">European Synchrotron Radiation Facility</a> I used Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) to depict the macro- to microanatomy of structurally normal and abnormal adult human hearts ex vivo. For more information see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.232731" target="_blank">the related paper</a>

      HiP-CT allows for high-spatial-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of the heart, revealing histologic-level detail without the need for invasive sectioning or exogenous contrast agents. The study involved imaging two hearts: one from a healthy 63-year-old male and another from an 87-year-old female with a history of cardiovascular diseases.

      The imaging revealed intricate details of the myocardium, valves, coronary arteries, and the cardiac conduction system, achieving resolutions ranging from 20 µm/voxel to as fine as 2 µm/voxel, allowing to observe some cells such as myocytes.

      HiP-CT also enabled the visualization of pathologic features such as fatty infiltration, vascular supply disruptions, and structural changes due to diseases like myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation.

      This study demonstrates the potential of HiP-CT for detailed, non-destructive imaging of the heart, which can greatly enhance our understanding of cardiac anatomy and disease, paving the way for better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
